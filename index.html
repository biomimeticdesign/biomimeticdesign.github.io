          Sustainable methods of problem solving <br/>
          The natural world is filled with patterns and functions that work together to run a self sustaining system. Human design often tries to manage nature to be more profitable but often disrupts the balance of the functioning ecosystems in place already. It is crucial to consider how your design will function, adapt and fit within the rest of the ecosystem.

          The answer is already there <br/>
          Nature has answers for a large majority of human centered problems and looking towards nature’s functions lets us (humans) benefit from nature’s resources while following the grain of natural processes, resulting in less conflict between human and natural design.

          Colour communication in nature <br/>
          Examples of colour used as a language are seen throughout many different lifeforms, ecosystems, and functions in nature. When looking at marine life, a multitude of complex colour systems emerge. Whether camoflauge, attraction, or communication, many marine animals are innately trained to use colour for their advantage and have honed the ability to communicate “don’t eat me” or “ don’t ignore me” through colour systems. This ability affects the way that all species interpret colour, including humans. Similar to human design, nature will always have a ‘target audience’ in mind when designing systems of communication.

          Non-permanence <br/>
          A quality that makes the systems in nature function so efficiently is non-permanence. This means that everything is ever-changing and evolving at the circumstances, creating a remarkable sense of adaptability. Think of changes in season, natural disasters, or the way nature has learned to grow around a series of human distruptions to natural systems.

          Waste = food <br/>
          A principle of nature in design, the concept of looking at waste as food can be seen in systems of renewable energy and resources in various ecosystems. Creating a circular design system that denies closed-loop practices. Janine Benyus remarks that should not “draw down resources, live off the interest” instead.

          Existing in relation <br/>
          Nature teaches us that nothing exists without an interconnectedness to everything else. To create means to build a relationship with the rest of the world. How does interconnectedness in human design affect a designer’s work? How can a consideration of connection propell a designer’s work?

          Innate harmony through grid <br/>
          A number of natural grid systems can be observed through both flora and fauna examples. Looking at hermit crab shells, flower petals or pinecones, it becomes clear that there is a mathematically precise system of harmony. A popular example is the golden ratio. Artists discovered early on that the golden ratio seen in nature created a sense of divine harmony in their work. Systems of natural grids are present in more aspects of life than is easily discernible.

          (Re)connect <br/>
          Applying biomimicry to human design requires a level of connectedness to nature. Though we may all live, breathe and exist in natural systems, Janine Benyus brings to light the significant role that an intentional (re)connection to nature plays. This is part of the ethos that a designer embodies when designing in the interest of the client, themselves, and the ecosphere.

          Symbols in nature <br/>
          Symbolism in nature can be seen through colour, texture, form, sound and taste. When communicating in nature, every sense is considered. This is relfected in the systems of symbolism and standardized communication that human design uses.

          Biomimicry and biomorphism <br/>
          Although often used interchangeably, there is a steep difference between biomimicry and biomorphism. While biomimicry looks at emulating the function, circular systems, and behaviours observed in nature, biomorphism aims to emulate the physical, aesthetic appearance of nature. The two are closely related yet can produce vastly different outcomes. This difference highlights that nature is fundamental as a guide, not just an inspiration. Ultimately, both practices can be useful to graphic design

          Iterative design <br/>
          Like many graphic designers, nature shows a highly iterative manner of creating. This emphasizes the allure of never finalizing anything. Iteration after iteration, the natural world continues to adapt and prototype. This contrasts greatly from a human desire for ‘finished’ work. Nature embraces constant transformation and translation.
